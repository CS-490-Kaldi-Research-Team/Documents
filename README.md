CS 491 Kaldi ASR Team

23 January 2024
## Kaldi ASR Team Product Vision Statement
The Kaldi ASR Toolkit is an open-source toolkit created in 2009 by Johns Hopkins University that is designed to create automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. The Kaldi ASR Team shall utilize the toolkit to develop its own ASR models to transcribe live or prerecorded Air Traffic Control (ATC) transmissions. A set of models shall be created, then trained with a 30-hour ATC dataset. By comparing the performance between each trained model (e.g., transcription accuracy, runtime, et cetera), the team shall assess which model is most suitable for creating an online speech recognition tool to transcribe live ATC transmissions in the future. The finished product for this semester shall be several trained models that transcribe speech signal files into text.
